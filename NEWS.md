# xlr 1.1.0

## New Features

* Added `make_wider()` function to easily pivot outputs from `build_table()` and related functions for creating wider table formats.
* Added support for `exclude_codes` parameter in multiple response questions for the
function `build_mtable()`. This parameter supports passing values like `-99` that
should be excluded from the analysis. See the documentation for `build_mtable()`.
* Added column width support to `xlr_format()`, instead of `xlr` trying to guess
the width.
* Created a new type `xlr_n_percent`, which combines a count and a percentage. Like all
other `xlr` types, it can be written to Excel. 

## Vector Arithmetic & Type System Improvements

* Added vector arithmetic support (`vctrs::vec_math()`) for `xlr` types. Most base R
vector operations are now supported (e.g., `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`). See `vctrs::vec_math()` 
for more details on supported operations.
* `xlr_integer` now supports division and conversion to numeric (returns `xlr_numeric`).
* Added support for type conversion between all `xlr` types. You can now convert
all `xlr` types to each other, e.g., `xlr_numeric` to `xlr_integer`, `xlr_percent` to
`xlr_integer`.
* `xlr_percent` now works with ggplot2 without errors.
* `as.character()` on `xlr_percent` now returns formatted percentage strings.
* Refactored xlr classes to inherit from base types for better compatibility.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug in `build_qtable()` where an `NA` value in one column resulted
in the entire row being removed.
* Improved error handling in internal tidyr function calls.

## Documentation & Testing

* Relaxed restrictions on column value requirements for `build_qtable()`. Response
values for each column in the block only need to be a subset of the first column.
* Improved documentation for question-related functions.
* Added tests for ggplot2 compatibility.
* Updated snapshots for remote tests.
* Updated DESCRIPTION file for latest roxygen2 version.

# xlr 1.0.3

- CRAN re-submission:
    - Fixed title and description to follow CRAN's standards (moved from 
    back-ticks to single quotes)!
    
# xlr 1.0.2

- CRAN re-submission:
    - Fixed title to follow CRAN's standards.
    
# xlr 1.0.1

-   CRAN re-submission. Fix issues:
    -   Made `Excel` referenced in back-ticks \`\`.
    -   Removed externally facing documentation for internal package functions.
    -   Changed examples so that they no longer use `\dontrun` but instead create a temporary working directory following `readr` examples. We instead use `\dontshow` to hide setting this working directory.
    -   Fixed typos in the vignette.
    -   Fixed line spacing issues with the Description due to inconsistent space sizing.

# xlr 1.0.0
